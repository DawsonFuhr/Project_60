        <p>An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.The longer he lived the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him  because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.But one day when he turned eighty years old an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour An Old Man is happy today he doesnt complain about anything smiles and even his face is freshened up.The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:Village What happened to you Nothing special. Eighty years Ive been chasing happiness  and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That is why I m happy now. An Old Man.Moral of the story Dont chase happiness. Enjoy your life.
